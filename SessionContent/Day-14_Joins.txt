Joins

JOINS in SQL are commands which are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between those tables. 
We can write nested queries easily with the help of joins.

Types of Joins

Inner Join
Outer Join
Left Join
Right Join
Full Join
Cross Join
Self Join

Inner Join

Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
Syntax
SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
INNER JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;

General syntax of join
SELECT column-names
     FROM table1 JOIN table2
     ON column1 = column2  WHERE condition

Example 1
select * from Details d join StudentInfo s 
   ON d.Id = s.StudentID where s.name = d.Name

Example2
select * from Details d Inner join StudentInfo s 
   ON d.Id = s.StudentID where s.name = d.Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Outer Join

Types of Outer Join

Left Join
Right Join
Full Outer Join

a) Left Join
Select records from the first (left-most) table with matching right table records.

Returns all records from the left 
table, and the matched records 
from the right table

Syntax for left join 
SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
LEFT JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;
Example
select * from Details d left join StudentInfo s ON d.Id = s.StudentID

b) Right Join

Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. 

Example for Right join
SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
RIGHT JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;
Example
select * from Details d right join StudentInfo s ON d.Id = s.StudentID

c) full outer join

The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
Example for Right join
SELECT columns 
FROM table1 
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;
Example
select * from Details d right join StudentInfo s ON d.Id = s.StudentID where s.name = d.Name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cross join

The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table. This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product.

If WHERE clause is used with CROSS JOIN, it functions like an INNER JOIN

If table 1 has x rows and 
table 2 has y rows then the 
result set will be of x*y rows

Syntax for cross join
SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;

Example with out where clause
select * from Details d  CROSS JOIN StudentInfo s 
Example with where clause
select * from Details d  CROSS JOIN StudentInfo s where d.Id = s.StudentID 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
self join

No Join keyword will be used.
Tables that join by its self.

Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)FROM table1 T1, table1 T2WHERE condition;
Example
select * from Details d, StudentInfo s where d.Id = s.StudentID
