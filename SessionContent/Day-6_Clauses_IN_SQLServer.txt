Clauses in SQL Server
There are five types of clauses in SQL Server. 
They are Order By Clause, Top Clause, Where Clause, Group By Clause, and Having Clause.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Order By

Order By used to sort the data, either in Ascending or Descending order.
It sorts the records in ascending order by default.

Keywords
ASC: It is used to sort the result set in ascending order by expression.
DESC: It sorts the result set in descending order by expression.

Syntax

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition  
ORDER BY column1, column2... ASC|DESC;  
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TOP

The SQL TOP clause is used to limit the number of rows that are returned by a query.
Syntax
	SELECT TOP number | percent column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Example
	SELECT TOP 3 * FROM StudentInfo;
	SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM StudentInfo;
Example with where clause
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM StudentInfo WHERE name='Harry';
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM StudentInfo WHERE name='Harry';

--------------------------------------------------------------------

where clause

The SQL WHERE Clause is used to restrict the number of rows (or records) returned by the SELECT Statement. 
It returns the records only If the condition specified after the SQL WHERE keyword is TRUE.
Syntax
SELECT <Column Names> FROM <Tb name> WHERE <Conditions>
Example
Select * from table name where name='Harry‘;

--------------------------------------------------------------------

GROUP BY

SQL GROUP BY statement is used to arrange identical data into groups. The GROUP BY statement is used with the SQL SELECT statement.
The GROUP BY statement follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.
The GROUP BY statement is used with aggregation function.

Aggregation function
SUM, MIN, AVG, MAX, and COUNT
SUM - Calculates the sum of values in column.
MIN- Gets the minimum value in a set of values.
MAX- Gets the maximum value in a set of values.
AVG - Calculates the average of a set of values.
COUNT- It gives the Count of a specified column 

Syntax for Group By
SELECT column  FROM table_name  WHERE conditions GROUP BY column  ORDER BY column;

Example – Count
SELECT Name, COUNT(*)  FROM details  GROUP BY Name;
SELECT COUNT(*), Name FROM details GROUP BY Name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
AVG
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) as Salary  FROM details  GROUP BY Department;
MIN
SELECT Department, MIN(Salary) as Salary  FROM details  GROUP BY Department
MAX
SELECT Department, MAX(Salary) as Salary  FROM details  GROUP BY Department

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having

In Having we will define a condition, based on that condition query will get executed.
The HAVING clause is often used with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups based on a specified condition.
Like GROUP BY, having is also uses Aggregation function

Syntax

SELECT * FROM <table_name> GROUP BY <group_list> HAVING <conditions>;
SUM

SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS "Total Salary“ FROM details
    GROUP BY department HAVING SUM(Salary) >= 5000;

MIN
SELECT Department, MIN(Salary) AS "MIN Salary“ FROM details
    GROUP BY department HAVING MIN(Salary) <= 4000;
MAX
SELECT Department, MAX(Salary) AS “Maximum Salary“ FROM details GROUP BY department HAVING MAX(Salary) <= 4000;
AVG
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS "Avg Salary“ FROM details
    GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(Salary) > 5000;
