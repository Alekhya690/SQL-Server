TCL-Transaction Control Language

TCL commands can only use with DML commands like INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE .
These operations are automatically committed in the database that's why they cannot be used while creating tables or dropping them.
Here are some commands that come under TCL:
COMMIT
ROLLBACK
SAVEPOINT

Commit

It is used to save all the transactions to the database.
Syntax
begin tran<tran_name>
	SQL Command
Commit tran <tran_name>

Example
begin tran d  
		INSERT into details values (‘11','Akshi', ‘    ‘23', '25333', 'Developer')
commit tran d 


Rollback in SQL Server
 
Rollback is used to undo the changes made by any command but only before a commit is done. We can't Rollback data which has been committed in the database with the help of the commit keyword.
 
Syntax
 
begin tran tranName
Command for operation
Rollback tran tranName

SAVEPOINT

SAVEPOINT command is used to temporarily save a transaction so that you can rollback to that point whenever required.
With out saveback we cannot roalback.

Syntax
SAVE { TRAN | TRANSACTION } { savepoint_name | @savepoint_variable } [ ; ] 
Example
SAVE  TRANSACTION  FirstInsert

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example for ROLLBACK & SAVEPOINT

BEGIN TRANSACTION 
INSERT into details values ('16','geetha', '20', '253333', 'Admin')
SAVE TRANSACTION FirstInsert
INSERT into details values ('17','geetha', '20', '253333', 'Admin')
ROLLBACK TRANSACTION FirstInsert
COMMIT
